	<h1>About me.</h1>
	<p> So, you want to know about me. For starters, I am from Krypton and here to save you. </p>
	<p> Okay, you did not buy that. </p>
	<p> I am a senior undergraduate studying Electronics Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, (BHU), Varanasi, India. I am passionate about Electronics. <a href="http://tokencolour.github.io/cv/TanuHariDixit_elinux.pdf"> Here </a> is my CV, if you are into those kind of things. Moreover, I like to read poetry (both in Hindi and in English). I used to write poems too but that muscle in me is atrophied as of now. I make stupid jokes and the only enthusiastic audience I get is myself. I love my jokes. Sorry.

I need to find a buyer for it since my undergraduation is about to get over but I can't bring myself to sell it. Furthermore, I am crazy about songs and music and I occasionally read.</div><!-- /.blurb -->
