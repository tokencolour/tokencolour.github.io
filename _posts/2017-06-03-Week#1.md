I converted the documentation of ``rtems-tester`` which was a txt file [here](https://github.com/RTEMS/rtems-tools/blob/master/doc/rtems-tester.txt) to ReST format in Sphinx. 
I am documenting my workflow for building Sphinx documentation after making changes:
```
$ cd development/rtems/src/rtems-docs/
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
$ git checkout -b branchname
```

---Do changes---

```
$ export PATH=${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}
```
We have added the path where sphinxcontrib-bibtex resides.

```
$ ./waf configure --sphinx-verbose=-v
$ ./waf clean build
```
Builds for me. :grinning:

I had to undo commits a lot of times due to my mistakes. Good thing I learnt 
how to do that.
The patches are in two commits: one commit includes the documentation in line 
with the new release of RTEMS (4.12) that is coming in.
In another commit, I have included the section for extending the support for 
more BSPs. Hence this section contains the format for INI configuration files. 
Should a user feel that a bsp he works on, should be supported by the 
``rtems-tester``, he will add his file in accordance to the format guidelines.
Also, Chris discussed how we could just name the section for bsp specifics in 
each of the INI files after the respective bsps and create a ``master-include.ini``
(maybe not that fancy a name). This file will be a top level configuration
file.
 
For example:
```
[bsp]
bsp = 'arm7tdmi'
arch = 'arm'

[gdb_script]
gdb = '%{_rtscripts}/gdb.cfg'
gdb_script ='arm7tdmi_gdb_script'
arm7tdmi_gdb_script =   'target sim
    load
    run'
```

v/s

```
[arm7tdmi]
bsp = 'arm7tdmi'
arch = 'arm'

[gdb_script]
gdb = '%{_rtscripts}/gdb.cfg'
gdb_script ='arm7tdmi_gdb_script'
arm7tdmi_gdb_script =   'target sim
    load
    run'
```

If we follow the section naming as in second alternative here, we will be able
to differentiate between different bsps and more so on ``section`` level.
We can have ``master-include.ini`` :smile:

```
[bsps]
include =   arm7tdmi.mc
            arm7tdmi-run.mc
            arm920.mc
            arm920-run.mc
            arm1136jfs.mc
            arm1136jfs-run.mc
            arm1136js.mc
            arm1136js-run.mc
            armcortexa9.mc
            armcortexa9-run.mc
            erc32.mc
            erc32-run.mc
            h8sxsim.mc
            h8sxsim-run.mc
            leon2.mc
            leon2-run.mc
            leon3.mc
            leon3-run.mc
            m32csim.mc
            m32csim-run.mc
            simsh1.mc
            simsh1-run.mc
            simsh2.mc
            simsh2-run.mc
            simsh2e.mc
            simsh2e-run.mc
            simsh4.mc
            simsh4-run.mc
            sis.mc 
```

and so on. 
This way we can include it once in the beginning (of running the rtems-tester)
and if we make a change to the way they are parsed and loaded, we would need 
to run the tool once (and not as many times as the number of configuration files.)
