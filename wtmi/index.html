	<h1>Where The Music Is.</h1>
	<p> To quote Bob Marley, "The good thing about music is that when it hits you, you feel no pain." </p>
	<p> Also one quote from David Gilmour, which is not very relevant here, but I strongly relate to it. Also because, I dearly respect his work:
	<p> "For long you live and high you fly
		 And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
		 And all you touch and all you see
		 Is all your life will ever be"</p>
	<p> Here is a list of songs and music I'll recommend, should you ask. </p>
	<p>  </p>
