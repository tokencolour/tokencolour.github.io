	<h1>Where The Music Is.</h1>
	<p> To quote Bob Marley, "The good thing about music is that when it hits you, you feel no pain." </p>
	<p> Also one quote from David Gilmour, which is not very relevant here, but has a strong meaning. Also because, I love his lyrics:
	<p> "For long you live and high you fly</p>
	<p> And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry</p>
	<p> And all you touch and all you see</p>
	<p> Is all your life will ever be"</p>
	<p> Here is a list of songs and music I'll recommend, should you ask. </p>
